## Why?

- I always wanted a deck of cards that was my own.
- I always wanted a deck for playing [Bisca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisca_(card_game)) or [Sueca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sueca_(card_game)).
    - Specifically, I wanted a deck with the card values printed *(because I can never remember them!)*
- Wanted to keep the traditional Spanish-/Italian-suited faces (Coins,Cups,Clubs,Swords), but also the French-/Anglo-suited faces ( :spades:, :hearts:, :clubs:, :diamonds: ) ... i.e. a hybrid, keeping both.
    - :spades: Spades &larr;&rarr; Coins
    - :hearts: Hearts &larr;&rarr; Cups (Chalice)
    - :clubs: Clubs &larr;&rarr; Clubs (Baseball bats)
    - :diamonds: Diamonds &larr;&rarr; Swords (Daggers)
    - *The traditional evolution from Latin to Franco playing card faces indicates that diamonds are derived from coins and spades are from swords. However, in the Latin deck, the Coin serves as the primary face, whereas in the French deck, the Spade holds that position. Therefore, I opted to represent the spade as a coin, maintaining a common primary face.*

- Loved the idea of a [four-color deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-color_deck). So will go with:
    - &#x2664; :black_large_square: Black *(keeps tradition)*
    - &#x2661; :red_square: Red *(keeps tradition)*
    - &#x2667; :blue_square: Blue *(best and closest to black)*
    - &#x2662; :green_square:   Green *(not like red, but significantly contrasted to the other colors)*
    - ***Note:** Does not follow Mike Caro's sequence of &#x2667; Green and &#x2662; Blue, as, IMO, the blue is closer to back than it is to red.*

- Cards are sized for production with [MakePlayingCards.com](https://makeplayingcards.com) ("MPC") on a standard 2.5"×3.5" (63.5×89mm) Poker card, with MPC's bleed accounted for.
