# Bisca-Sueca-Playing-Cards

Graphics for the Bisca/Sueca Playing Cards set

## Why?

- Always wanted a deck of cards that was my own.
- Always wanted a desk for playing [Sueca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sueca_(card_game)) or [Bisca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisca_(card_game)) *(Yes, I authored those Wikipedia pages.)*
    - Specifically I wanted a deck with the card values printed 'cause I can never remember them!
- Wanted to keep the traditional Spanish-suited faces (Coins,Cups,Clubs,Swords), but also the French-suited faces (:spades:,:hearts:,:clubs:,:diamonds:) ... i.e. a hybrid keeping both.
    - :spades: = Coins
    - :hearts: = Cups (Chalice)
    - :clubs: = Clubs (Baseball bats)
    - :diamonds: = Swords (Daggers)

- Loved the idea of a [Four-color_deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-color deck). So will go with:
    - :spades: Black
    - :hearts: Red
    - :clubs: Blue
    - :diamonds: Green
