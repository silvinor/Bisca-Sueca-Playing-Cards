## Why?

- Always wanted a deck of cards that was my own.
- Always wanted a desk for playing [Bisca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisca_(card_game)) or [Sueca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sueca_(card_game)).
    - Specifically I wanted a deck with the card values printed *(because I can never remember them!)*
- Wanted to keep the traditional Spanish-/Italian-suited faces (Coins,Cups,Clubs,Swords), but also the French-/Anglo-suited faces (:spades:,:hearts:,:clubs:,:diamonds:) ... i.e. a hybrid, keeping both.
    - :spades: Spades = Coins
    - :hearts: Hearts = Cups (Chalice)
    - :clubs: Clubs = Clubs (Baseball bats)
    - :diamonds: Diamonds = Swords (Daggers)
    - *Traditional evolution from Latin to French pips was that the Diamonds came from Coins, and the Spades came from Swords, but in the Latin deck the Coin is the primary face, whilst in the French deck the Spade is the primary ... and so I chose to make the spade a Coin, keeping the primary face common.*

- Loved the idea of a [Four-color_deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-color deck). So will go with:
    - &#x2664; :black_large_square: Black *(keeps tradition)*
    - &#x2661; :red_square: Red *(keeps tradition)*
    - &#x2667; :blue_square: Blue *(best and closest to black)*
    - &#x2662; :green_square:   Green *(not like red, but significantly contrasted to the other colors)*
